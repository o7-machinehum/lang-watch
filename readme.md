![](img/watchy.gif)
Lang watch is an modification of the Watchy firmware to help with language learning, every 15 minutes the watch will ping you and quiz you on certain words. Right now you need to edit the words in `lib/Watchy/src/Watchy.cpp`

Everything in the `lib` folder is from here https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy

Flashing the hardware...
```
pio run --target upload
```
